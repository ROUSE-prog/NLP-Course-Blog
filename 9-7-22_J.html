    <h4>Gauss-Jordan Elimination</h4>
   <p>Well this is going to take a youtube video or a few to get a better understanding of but its pretty understandable so far. </p> 

   <h4>Using Linear Algebra with Python.</h4>
   <p>NumPy will the library of choice to use linear Algebra.
      practiced array combinations by joining the arrays of Matrices.
    </p>
    <h4>Additional Linear Algebra Operations</h4>
    <p>Worked on more Multiplying Matricies and got a better look at the pattern.
        Working with NumPy makes things so much smoother in terms of looking at one point of the equation.
    </p>
    <h4>Finished the intro into Linear Algebra</h4>
    <p>Got my ass Kicked and it felt GREAT! The feeling of seeing a new concept and breaking it down till its understandable is a something to always strive for. 
    The Python library NumPy provides a powerful tool to programmatically perform linear algebra. A fundamental building block of NumPy, the NumPy array,
    allows us to represent vectors and matrices. These arrays can perform operations directly, such as addition and scalar multiplication using + and *, rerspectively.
    NumPy also has built-in functions that allow us to perform more advanced operations like dot products, transposes, and matrix multiplication
    Finally, NumPy has a numpy.linalg sublibrary that provides more advanced functionality. This includes finding the norm (or magnitude/length) of a vector, 
    finding the inverse of a square matrix, and solving a system of linear equations in Ax=b form.
    All this functionality will allow us to use Python and NumPy to solve many linear algebra problems, including linear regression, in future lessons and articles.</p>
