    <h1>This will be a few pages on NLP - Natrual Language Processsing.</h1>
   <h3>From a beginner this will serve as my path tracker and allow me to really break this all down into segments that can be later diguested and reworked.</h3> 

    <h4>Starting with Linear Algebra.</h4>
   <p>This is a new concept for me, a bit nervous because of the name "Algebra" still haunts me from a decade ago...
       jumping into and going to work throught the concepts understanding its for a strong foundation.

   <h4>Vectors</h4>
   <p>So this so far is a bit complex in the sense that we are dealing with something on a multi-dimenional scale.
       ...After getting a good look at Vector Add and Sub tract i had a comfotable understanding of how to do short math with vectors.
   </p>

   <h4>Matricies</h4>
   <p> I can now see how things can lokk complex from the outside, Inside the Matrix is the next dimenionalal scale up of Vectors.
       Looking at how to understand the Matrix table is pretty readable.

       Need practice on Multiplying Matrices. That was pretty interesting, I like the readablity of it so far.
   </p>
    
   <h4>Wrap-Up</h4>
   <p>This was a great introduction into Linear Algebra. I'll practice alot more with Matrices and other algorithms tomorrow to get my head around this first Chapter.</p>
